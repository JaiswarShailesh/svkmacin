            <h3>About SVKM</h3>
            <p className="fst-italic">
              Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal is a Public Charitable Trust
              registered under the Societyâ€™s Registration Act and Bombay Public
              Trust Act. From its humble beginnings in 1934, when it took over
              the Rashtriya Shala, a school established in 1921 in the wake of
              the National Movement, the Mandal today has grown into a big
              educational complex imparting high-level education to more than
              35,000 students.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ethos of the Mandal, is marked by patriotic fervor, selfless
              service and a spirit of indigenous enterprise. These values
              permeate all the institutions set up by the Mandal and are the
              guiding principles for all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              After beginning its journey in the early 1930s SVKM has blossomed
              into an educational colossus that has attained national
              recognition in multiple streams of higher education. With a strong
              guiding philosophy of providing education to all levels of the
              student community along with creating a feeling of bonding and
              commitment amongst academic and nonacademic employees.
